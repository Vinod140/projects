# 🧠 Custom Object Detection System

A complete custom object detection system that allows you to detect user-defined objects in real-time. This project integrates data labeling (via Label Studio), model training (via YOLO), real-time detection (via OpenCV), and a user interface (via Tkinter).

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Label Studio** – For image annotation and labeling
- **YOLOv8** – For training object detection models
- **OpenCV** – For handling camera input and image processing
- **Tkinter** – For building a simple GUI to run detection
- **Python** – Glue language for everything

## 🔁 Workflow

1. **Label your custom dataset** using [Label Studio].
2. **Convert annotations** to YOLO format.
3. **Train your YOLO model** (e.g. using `ultralytics` package).
4. **Run detection** using your trained model in real-time via webcam.
5. **Control the system** through a Tkinter-based GUI.
